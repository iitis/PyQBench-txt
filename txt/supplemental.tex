\section{Existing benchmarking methodologies and software}
Unsurprisingly, PyQBench is not the only software package for benchmarking gate--based devices.
While we believe that our approach has significant benefits over other benchmarking techniques, for
completeness, in this section we discuss some of the currently available similar software.

Probably the simplest benchmarking method one could devise is simply running known algorithms and
comparing outputs with the expected ones. Analyzing the frequency of the correct outputs, or the
deviation between actual and expected outputs distribution provides then a metric of the performance
of a given device. Libraries such as Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) \cite{mqt2022, mqt-bench} or
SupermarQ \cite{supermarq, supermarkq-github} contain benchmarks leveraging multiple algorithms,
such as Shor's algorithm or Grover's algorithm.
% or  implementing e.g. GHZ state \cite{ghz}.
Despite being intuitive and easily interpretable, such benchmarks may have some problems. Most
importantly, they assess the usefulness of a quantum device only for a very particular algorithm,
and it might be hard to extrapolate their results to other algorithms and applications. For
instance, the inability of a device to consistently find factorizations using Shor's algorithms does
not tell anything about its usefulness in Variational Quantum Algorithm's.

Another possible approach to benchmarking quantum computers is randomized benchmarking. In this
approach, one samples circuits to be run from some predefined set of gates (e.g. from the Clifford
group) and tests how much the output distribution obtained from the device running these circuits
differs from the ideal one. It is also common to concatenate randomly chosen circuits with their
inverses (which should yield the identity circuit) and run those concatenated circuits on the
device. Libraries implementing this approach include Qiskit \cite{qiskit-randomized} or PyQuil
\cite{forest-benchmarking}. Another, equally popular, benchmarking method is
quantum tomography \cite{bantysh2021quantum}. Implementation of quantum tomography for
benchmarking NISQ devices can be found in \cite{tomography}.

In \cite{patel2020experimental}, the authors evaluated several IBM-Q machines using seven benchmarks
taking into account the errors and execution time.

QASMBench \cite{li2023qasmbench} is one of the first benchmark suites aiming at evaluating NISQ
devices using quantum applications from a broad range of domains, mainly using an approach based on
fidelity estimation. The benchmark presented in the paper compares the fidelity of execution among
the IBM-Q machines, the IonQ QPU and the Rigetti Aspen M-1 system.

Another quantity used for benchmarking NISQ devices is quantum volume. The quantum volume
characterizes the capacity of a device for solving computational problems. It takes into account
multiple factors like the number of qubits, connectivity and measurement errors. The Qiskit library
allows one to measure the quantum volume of a device by using its \texttt{qiskit.ignis.verification.quantum\_volume}. Other implementations of Quantum Volume can be found as well, see e.g.
\cite{volume-in-practice}.

We should also mention cross-entropy
benchmarking~\cite{boixo2018characterizing}, which was utlilized in validation
of the Sycamore-53 QPU supremacy experiments~\cite{arute2019quantum}. In this
approach, the quality of an algorithm implemented on the QPU is measured by
calculating the cross entropy of bit-strings actually sampled from the QPU,
compared to ideal bitstrings.

Finally, it is worth pointing out there is an ongoing effort towards standardization
of benchmarking of quantum computers. In \cite{standardization}, the authors present
plans for designing a benchmarking suite based on measuring a set of standardized
key performance indicators (KPIs).

\section{Mathematical preliminaries} \label{app:preliminaries}
Let $\mathcal{M}_{d_1,d_2}$ be the set of all matrices of dimension $d_1 \times d_2$ over
the field $\mathbb{C}$. For  simplicity, square matrices will be denoted by
$\mathcal{M}_d$.
By $\Omega_d$, we will denote the set of quantum states, that is
positive semidefinite operators having trace equal to one.
The subset of $\mathcal{M}_d$ consisting of unitary matrices will be denoted
by $\UU_d$, while its subgroup of diagonal unitary operators will be denoted by
$\DD \UU_d$.


We will also need a linear mapping transforming $\mathcal{M}_{d_1}$ into
$\mathcal{M}_{d_2}$, which will be denoted
\begin{equation}
\Phi: \mathcal{M}_{d_1 } \rightarrow \mathcal{M}_{d_2}.
\end{equation}
There
exists a bijection between the set of linear mappings $\Phi$ and the set of matrices $\mathcal{M}_{d_1d_2}$,  known as the Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism.
For a given linear mapping $\Phi$ the corresponding Choi operator $J(\Phi)$ is explicitly written as
\begin{equation}
J(\Phi) \coloneqq \sum_{i,j=0}^{d- 1} \Phi(\ketbra{i}{j}) \otimes \ketbra{i}{j}. \end{equation}

We also introduce a special subset of all mappings $\Phi$, called quantum channels, which are completely positive
and trace preserving (CPTP).
In this work we will consider a special class of quantum channels, called unitary channels.  A
quantum channel
$\Phi_{U}$ is said to be a unitary channel if it has the following form $\Phi_U(\cdot) = U \cdot U^\dagger$ for any $U \in
\UU_d$.


Let us recall a  general form of a quantum measurement, so called Positive Operator Valued
Measure (POVM). A POVM $\PP$ is a collection of positive semidefinite operators $\{E_1, \ldots, E_m
\}$, called effects, that sum up to the identity operator, \ie $ \, \, \sum_{i=1}^m E_i = \1$.
In PyQBench, we are interested only in von Neumann measurements, that is measurements
for which all the effects are rank-one projectors. Every such measurement can be
parameterized by a unitary matrix $U \in \mathcal{U}_d$ with effects $\{\proj{u_0}, \ldots, \proj{u_{d-1}}\}$,
are created by taking $\ket{u_i}$ as  $(i+1)$-th column of the unitary matrix $U$.
We will denote von Neumann measurements described by the matrix $U$ by $\PP_{U}$.
The action of
von Neumann measurement $\PP_{U}$ on some state $\rho \in \Omega_d$ can be
seen as  a measure-and-prepare quantum channel as follows \begin{equation}
\PP_{U} : \rho \rightarrow \sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \bra{u_i} \rho \ket{u_i} \proj{i}.
\end{equation}
Moreover, observe that each von Neumann measurement $\PP_{U}$ poses a  composition of a unitary channel $\Phi_{U^\dagger}$ and the maximally dephasing channel $\Delta$, that means $\PP_{U} = \Delta \circ \Phi_{U^\dagger}$.

We need to also briefly discuss about the distance between quantum operations. From \cite[Theorem 1]{puchala2018strategies}, the distance between measurements $\PP_U$ and
$\PP_\Id$ can be expressed in the notion of diamond norm, that is
\begin{equation}
\|\PP_U - \PP_\Id\|_\diamond = \min_{E \in \diaguni_d} \|\Phi_{UE} -
\Phi_\Id\|_\diamond.
\end{equation} To express the distance between unitary channels, we need to introduce the definition of numerical range \cite{numericalrangle}. The set \begin{equation}
W(A) =\{\bra{x}A\ket{x}: \ket{x} \in
\mathbb{C}^d, \;
\;\braket{x}{x}=1\}
\end{equation}
is called the numerical range of  a given matrix $A \in \mathcal{M}_d$.
The detailed properties of the numerical range and its generalizations we can read on the website~\cite{nr}.

Due to the definition of $W(A)$, the distance between two unitary channels $\Phi_{U} $ and $\Phi_\Id$
can be written as
\begin{equation}
\| \Phi_U  - \Phi_{\1} \|_\diamond = 2 \sqrt{1-\nu^2},
\end{equation}
where $\nu = \min_{x \in W(U^\dagger)} |x|  $.


\section{Discrimination task for Hadamard gate}\label{app:hadamard}
For the discrimination task between von Neumann measurements $\PP_{U}$ and $\PP_\Id$, where $U = H$ (the Hadamard gate),  the key is to calculate the diamond norm $\| \mathcal{P}_H - \PP_\Id \|_\diamond$ and
determine the discriminator $\ket{\psi_0}$.
Using semidefinite programming \cite{watrous2021simplier}, we obtain
\begin{equation}
\| \mathcal{P}_H - \PP_\Id \|_\diamond = \sqrt{2}.
\end{equation}
From \cite{lewandowska2021certification} we have
\begin{equation}
\| \PP_{H} - \PP_{\Id} \|_\diamond = \| \Phi_{HE_0} - \Phi_{\Id}\|_\diamond,
\end{equation}
where $\Phi_{U}$ is a unitary channel and
 $E_0$
is of the form
\begin{equation}
E_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \begin{matrix}
1 + i & 0  \\  0 & -1-i
\end{matrix} \right).
\end{equation}
Next, in order to construct the discriminator $\ket{\psi_0}$ we use Lemma 5 and the proof of Theorem 1 in \cite{puchala2018strategies}. We show that there exist states
 $\rho_1 $  and $\rho_2$ of the form $ \rho_1  = \frac{1}{2} \left( \begin{matrix}
 1  & i  \\  -i & 1
 \end{matrix} \right)  $  and $\rho_2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \begin{matrix}
 1 & -i \\  i & 1
 \end{matrix} \right), $ respectively. Thus, we construct the quantum state $\rho_0$ as follows:
 \begin{equation}
 \rho_0 = \frac{1}{2} \rho_1 + \frac{1}{2} \rho_2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \begin{matrix}
 1  &  0  \\  0  & 1
 \end{matrix} \right).
 \end{equation}
 According to the Lemma 5 and the proof of Theorem 1 in \cite{puchala2018strategies} we assume that \begin{equation}
 \ket{\psi_0} = \left.\left| \sqrt{\rho_0^\top}\right\rangle \right\rangle.
 \end{equation}
 It directly implies that
 \begin{equation}
 \ket{\psi_0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{00} + \ket{11}).  \end{equation}
 Next, from Holevo-Helstrom theorem~\cite{watrous}, we determine the final measurement $\PP_{V_i}$.
 Let us consider \begin{equation}
 X = \left(\PP_{H} \otimes \Id \right)(\proj{\psi_0}) - \left(\PP_{\Id} \otimes \Id \right) (\proj{\psi_0}).
  \end{equation}
 From the Hahn-Jordan decomposition \cite{watrous}, let us note
 \begin{equation}
 X = P - Q,
 \end{equation}
 where $P, Q \ge 0 $.
 Let us define projectors $\Pi_P$ and $\Pi_Q$ onto  $\text{im}(P)$ and $\text{im}(Q)$,
 respectively. Observe, that $P $ and $Q$ are block-diagonal.  Then,  $\Pi_P$ and $\Pi_Q$ have the following forms
 \begin{equation}
 \Pi_P = \left(\begin{array}{cc}\proj{x_p}&0\\0&\proj{y_p}\end{array}\right),
 \end{equation}
 and
 \begin{equation}
 \Pi_Q = \left(\begin{array}{cc}\proj{x_q}&0\\0&\proj{y_q}\end{array}\right).
 \end{equation}
 Hence, we define $V_0$ as
 \begin{equation}
 \begin{cases} \ket{x_p} =  V_0  \ket{0} \\  \ket{x_q} =  V_0 \ket{1} \end{cases}
 \end{equation}
 and $V_1$ as
 \begin{equation}
 \begin{cases}
 \ket{y_p} =   V_1 \ket{0} \\
  \ket{y_q} = V_1  \ket{1}
 \end{cases}.
 \end{equation}
 For the discrimination task between $\PP_{H}$ and $\PP_{\Id}$ the explicit form of $V_0$ and $V_1$ is given as follows (see also \texttt{mathematics/optimal\_final\_measurement\_ \\ discrimination.nb} in the source code repository):
 \begin{equation}
 V_0 =
 \left(\begin{array}{cc} \alpha & -\beta\\ \beta & \alpha \end{array}\right),
 \end{equation}
 and \begin{equation}
 V_1 =
 \left(\begin{array}{cc} -\beta & \alpha \\ \alpha & \beta \end{array}\right),
 \end{equation}
 where \begin{equation}
 \alpha = \frac{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}}{2} = \cos\left( \frac{3}{8} \pi \right),
 \end{equation}
 and
 \begin{equation}
 \beta  = \frac{\sqrt{2  + \sqrt{2}}}{2} = \sin\left( \frac{3}{8} \pi \right).
 \end{equation}

\section{Optimal probability for parameterized Fourier family} \label{app:optimal-probability}
Let us focus on single-qubit von Neumann measurements $\PP_\1$ and $\PP_U$.
Assume that the unitary matrix $U$ is of the form
\begin{equation}
U = H
\left(\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\0&e^{i \phi}\end{array}\right)  H^\dagger
\end{equation}
where $H$ is the Hadamard matrix of dimension two and $\phi \in [0, 2 \pi)$.
In this section we present theoretical probability of correct
discrimination between these measurements. To do that, we will present an auxiliary lemma.
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:min-e-optimal}
	Let $U = H \diag(1, e^{i \phi}) H^\dagger$, $\phi \in [0, 2\pi)$ and	let
	$\Phi_U$ and $\Phi_\Id$ be two unitary channels. Then, the following equation holds
	\begin{equation}
	\min_{E \in \diaguni_2} \|\Phi_{UE} -
	\Phi_\Id\|_\diamond = \|\Phi_{U} -
	\Phi_\Id\|_\diamond,
	\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} Recall that the distance between two unitary channels is given by
	$
	\| \Phi_U  - \Phi_{\1} \|_\diamond = 2 \sqrt{1-\nu^2},
	$
	where $\nu = \min_{x \in W(U^\dagger)} |x|  $ for any $U \in \mathcal{U}_d$.
	For $U = H
	\left(\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\0&e^{i \phi}\end{array}\right)  H^\dagger$ the readers briefly observe that  $\nu^2 = 1 - \frac{|1 - e^{-i \phi} |^2 }{4} = 1 - \frac{|1 - e^{i \phi} |^2 }{4}$. So,
	\begin{equation}
	\|  \Phi_U  - \Phi_{\1} \|_\diamond = | 1 - e^{i \phi} |.
	\end{equation}
	It implies that it is enough to prove  \begin{equation}
	\min_{E \in \diaguni_2} \|\Phi_{UE} -
	\Phi_\Id\|_\diamond  = | 1 - e^{i \phi} |.
	\end{equation}
	This condition is equivalent to show that for every $E \in \diaguni_2$
	\begin{equation}
	 \nu_{E} \le  \frac{|1 + e^{i \phi} | }{2},
	\end{equation}
	where $\nu_E = \min_{x \in W(U^\dagger E)} |x|. $

	The celebrated Hausdorff-T{\"o}plitz theorem~\cite{hausdorff, toeplitz} states that
	$W(A)$ of any matrix $A \in \mathcal{M}_d$ is a convex set, and therefore we have
	\begin{equation}
	W(A) = \{ \tr(A \rho): \rho \in \Omega_d\}.
	\end{equation}
	So, we can assume that
	\begin{equation}
	\min_{\ket{x} \in \mathbb{C}^2:   \proj{x} = 1} |\bra{x}U^\dagger\ket{x}| =
	\min_{\rho \in \Omega_2} |\tr(U^\dagger\rho)|.
	\end{equation}
	Then, we have
	\begin{equation}
	 \nu_{E}  =   \min_{\rho \in
		\Omega_2} \left| \tr \left( \rho U E \right) \right|.
	\end{equation}
	For that, our task is reduced to show that for every  $E \in \diaguni_2$ there exists $\rho \in \Omega_2$ such that
	\begin{equation}
 | \tr \left(\rho U E\right) | \le \frac{|1 + e^{i \phi} | }{2}.
	\end{equation}


	Let us define $E = \left(\begin{array}{cc}E_0&0\\0&E_1\end{array}\right)  $
	and take $\rho =
	\left(\begin{array}{cc}\frac{1}{2}&0\\0&\frac{1}{2}\end{array}\right) $.
	From spectral theorem, let us decompose $U$ as
	\begin{equation}
	U= \lambda_0 \ketbra{x_0}{x_0} + \lambda_1 \ketbra{x_1}{x_1},
	\end{equation}
	where  for eigenvalue $\lambda_0 = 1$, the corresponding
	eigenvector is
	of the form $\ket{x_0} = \left[\begin{array}{c}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\\\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\end{array}\right]
	$,
	whereas for  $\lambda_1= e^{i \phi}$ we have $\ket{x_1} = \left[\begin{array}{c}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\\-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\end{array}\right]
	$.
	Then, for every $ E \in \diaguni_2 $ we have
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
 | \tr (\rho U E) | & =   \frac{1}{2}  \left| \tr \left(
	H \diag(1, e^{i\phi}) H^\dagger E \right) \right| =
	\frac{1}{2} \left| \tr\left((   \proj{x_0} +e^{i \phi}\proj{x_1} ) E \right)
	\right| \\& =
	\frac{1}{2} \left|  \bra{x_0} E \ket{x_0} +  e^{i \phi}\bra{x_1} E \ket{x_1}
	\right| =
	\frac{1}{2} \left| \frac{E_0 + E_1}{2} + e^{i \phi } \frac{E_0+E_1}{2} \right|
	\\& =
	\frac{\left| 1+ e^{i \phi } \right|}{2} \left| \frac{E_0 + E_1}{2} \right| \le
\frac{|1 + e^{i \phi} | }{2},
	\end{split}
	\end{equation}
	which completes the proof.
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}\label{th:probability}
	The optimal probability of correct discrimination between von Neumann
	measurements $\PP_U$ and $\PP_{\Id}$ for $U = H \diag(1, e^{i \phi}) H^\dagger$,
	where $\phi \in [0, 2\pi)$ is given by
	\begin{equation}
	p_{\text{succ}}(\PP_{U}, \PP_{\Id}) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{|1 - e^{i \phi}  |}{4} .
	\end{equation}
\end{theorem}


\begin{proof}
	From Holevo-Helstrom theorem, we obtain
	\begin{equation}
	p_{\text{succ}}(\PP_{U}, \PP_{\Id}) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} \| \PP_{U} - \PP_{\Id} \|_\diamond.
	\end{equation}
	From~\cite[Theorem 1]{puchala2018strategies}, we have
	\begin{equation}
	\|\PP_U - \PP_\Id\|_\diamond = \min_{E \in \diaguni_d} \|\Phi_{UE} -
	\Phi_\Id\|_\diamond.
	\end{equation}
	From Lemma~\ref{lemma:min-e-optimal},  we know that for
	$U =  H \diag(1, e^{i \phi}) H^\dagger$,  it also holds that
	\begin{equation}
	\min_{E \in \diaguni_2} \|\Phi_{UE} -
	\Phi_\Id\|_\diamond = \|\Phi_{U} -
	\Phi_\Id\|_\diamond,
	\end{equation} which is exactly equal to
	\begin{equation}
	\|\Phi_{U} -
	\Phi_\Id\|_\diamond = 2\sqrt{1 - \nu^2} = |1-e^{i   \phi }|.
	\end{equation}
	It implies that
	\begin{equation}
	p_{\text{succ}}(\PP_{U}, \PP_{\Id}) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{|1-e^{i \phi}|}{4},
	\end{equation} which completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\section{Optimal discrimination strategy for parameterized Fourier family} \label{app:optimal-strategy}

In this Appendix we create the optimal
theoretical strategy of  discrimination between $\PP_{U}$ and $\PP_{\Id}$.
To indicate the optimal strategy, we will present two propositions. The first one is concentrated around the discriminator as the optimal input state of discrimination strategy, whereas the second one describes the optimal final measurement.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop-discrim}
	Consider the problem of discrimination between von Neumann measurements $\PP_U$
	and $\PP_\1$, $U = H\diag(1, e^{i \phi}) H^\dagger $ and $\phi \in [0,
	2\pi)$.  The  discriminator has the form
	\begin{equation}
	\ket{\psi_{0}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |\Id_2 \rangle \rangle.
	\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	Let $U = H\diag(1, e^{i \phi}) H^\dagger, \phi \in [0,
	2\pi)$ be decomposed as
	\begin{equation}
	U= \lambda_0 \ketbra{x_0}{x_0} + \lambda_1 \ketbra{x_1}{x_1},
	\end{equation}
	where  for eigenvalue $\lambda_0 = 1$, the corresponding
	eigenvector is
	of the form $\ket{x_0} = \left[\begin{array}{c}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\\\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\end{array}\right]
	$,
	whereas for  $\lambda_1 = e^{i \phi}$ we have $\ket{x_1} = \left[\begin{array}{c}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\\-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\end{array}\right]
	$.
	For Hermitian-preserving maps \cite{watrous} the diamond norm may be expressed as
	\begin{equation}
	\| \Phi  \|_\diamond =  \max_{\rho \in \Omega_d} \| \left( \Id \otimes \sqrt{\rho} \right) J(\Phi)  \left( \Id \otimes \sqrt{\rho} \right)  \|_1.  \end{equation}
	Hence, we obtain
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	\| \PP_{U} - \PP_{\Id}  \|_\diamond
	& =  \max_{\rho \in \Omega_2} \left\| \left( \Id \otimes \sqrt{\rho} \right)
	J(\PP_{U} - \PP_{\Id} )  \left( \Id \otimes \sqrt{\rho} \right)  \right\|_1
	\\
	& =  \max_{\rho \in \Omega_2} \left\| \left( \Id \otimes \sqrt{\rho} \right)
	\sum_{i=0}^{1} \proj{i} \otimes \left( \proj{u_i} - \proj{i} \right)^\top
\left( \Id \otimes \sqrt{\rho} \right) 	\right\|_1  \\
	& = \max_{\rho \in \Omega_2} \left\| \sum_{i=0}^{1} \proj{i} \otimes
	\sqrt{\rho}  \left( \proj{u_i} - \proj{i} \right)^\top \sqrt{\rho}  \right\|_1
	\\
	& = \max_{\rho \in \Omega_2} \sum_{i=0}^{1} \left\| \sqrt{\rho}  \left(
	\proj{u_i} - \proj{i} \right)^\top \sqrt{\rho}  \right\|_1.
	\end{split}
	\end{equation}
	One can prove that for all $\alpha, \beta \ge 0 $, and unit vectors $\ket{x},
	\ket{y}$ the following equation holds~\cite{watrous}
	\begin{equation}
	\| \alpha \proj{x} - \beta\proj{y} \|_1 = \sqrt{(\alpha + \beta)^2 - 4\alpha
		\beta |\braket{x}{y}|^2}.
	\end{equation}
	By taking $\ket{x} = \frac{\sqrt{\rho} \ket{\bar{u_i}}}{\| \sqrt{\rho}
		\ket{\bar{u_i}} \|}$ and $ \ket{y} = \frac{\sqrt{\rho} \ket{i}}{\|\sqrt{\rho}
		\ket{i} \|}$ we have
	\begin{equation}
	\| \PP_{U} - \PP_{\Id}  \|_\diamond  = \max_{\rho \in \Omega_2}
	\sum_{i=0}^{1} \sqrt{\left( \bra{\bar{u_i}} \rho \ket{\bar{u_i}} + \bra{i} \rho \ket{i
		}\right)^2 - 4 | \bra{\bar{u_i}} \rho \ket{i} |^2}.
	\end{equation}
	Let us take  $\rho_0 =   \frac{1}{2}
	\left(\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\0&1\end{array}\right)  $,   we obtain
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}

	&\ge \sum_{i=0}^1
	\sqrt{\left(\bra{\bar{u_i}}\rho_0\ket{\bar{u_i}} + \bra{i} \rho_0 \ket{i} \right)^2 -
		4|\bra{i}\rho_0\ket{\bar{u_i}}|^2}  \\
	&= \sum_{i=0}^1  \sqrt{ 1 -  \left| \bra{i}  U \ket{i }\right|^2}
	\\
	&=\sum_{i=0}^1  \sqrt{1 -  \left| 1 \cdot \braket{i}{u_0}
		\braket{u_0}{i} + e^{i \phi} \cdot\braket{i}{u_1} \braket{u_1}{i}\right|^2} \\
	&= \sum_{i=0}^1

	&= |1-e^{i \phi }|.
	\end{split}
	\end{equation}
	Due to Theorem \ref{th:probability} and the following equality
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
 \| \left( \Id \otimes \sqrt{\rho} \right) J(\PP_{U} - \PP_{\Id} )  \left(
	\Id \otimes \sqrt{\rho} \right) \|_1 = \left\| ( (\PP_{U} - \PP_\Id) \otimes \Id) \left(  | \sqrt{\rho}^\top
	\rangle \rangle \langle \langle \sqrt{\rho}^\top | \right) \right\|_1,
	\end{split}
	\end{equation}
the discriminator $\ket{\psi_0}$
 is equal to  \begin{equation}
	\ket{\psi_{0}} =  | \sqrt{\rho_0}^\top
	\rangle \rangle  = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} } |
	\Id_2 \rangle \rangle,
	\end{equation}
	which completes the proof.
\end{proof}


\begin{proposition}\label{prop:optimal-measurement}
	Consider the problem of discrimination between von Neumann measurements $\PP_U$
	and $\PP_\1$, $U = H\diag(1, e^{i \phi}) H^\dagger $ and $\phi \in [0,
	2\pi)$.
	The   controlled unitaries $V_0$ and $V_1$
	have the form
	\begin{equation}
	V_0 = \left(\begin{array}{cc}i \sin\left( \frac{\pi - \phi}{4} \right)&-i
	\cos\left( \frac{\pi - \phi}{4} \right)\\ \cos\left( \frac{\pi -
		\phi}{4}\right)& \sin\left( \frac{\pi - \phi}{4} \right)\end{array}\right),
	\end{equation}
	and
	\begin{equation}
	V_1 = \left(\begin{array}{cc}-i \cos\left(\frac{\pi - \phi}{4}\right) &i
	\sin\left( \frac{\pi - \phi}{4}\right)\\\sin\left( \frac{\pi - \phi}{4} \right)
	&  \cos\left( \frac{\pi - \phi}{4} \right) \end{array}\right).
	\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	From Proposition~\ref{prop-discrim} we obtain the exact form of discriminator given by
	\begin{equation}
	\ket{\psi_0}  = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |\Id_2
	\rangle \rangle.
	\end{equation}
	Repeating the procedure used to distinguish the von Neumann measurements in the Hadamard basis (see \ref{app:hadamard}), we use the Hahn-Jordan decomposition and then we create the projective operators into the positive and negative part of $X$ matrix.
	Hence, the explicit form of $V_0$ and $V_1$ is given as
	follows:
	\begin{equation}
	V_0 = \left(
	\begin{array}{cc}i \sin\left( \frac{\pi - \phi}{4} \right)&-i
	\cos\left( \frac{\pi - \phi}{4} \right)\\ \cos\left( \frac{\pi -
		\phi}{4}\right)& \sin\left( \frac{\pi - \phi}{4} \right)
	\end{array}
	\right),
	\end{equation}
and
	\begin{equation}
	V_1 = \left(\begin{array}{cc}-i \cos\left(\frac{\pi - \phi}{4}\right) &i
	\sin\left( \frac{\pi - \phi}{4}\right)\\\sin\left( \frac{\pi - \phi}{4}
	\right) &  \cos\left( \frac{\pi - \phi}{4} \right) \end{array}\right),
	\end{equation}
	where $\phi \in [0,2\pi)$.
\end{proof}

For the same experiment file, we use the flag \texttt{asynchronous: true} to define asynchronous experiment.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Backend file]
name: ibmq_quito
asynchronous: true

	hub: ibm-q
	group: open

\end{lstlisting}
If the backend is asynchronous, the output will contain intermediate data
containing, amongst others, job ids correlated with the circuit they
correspond to.
