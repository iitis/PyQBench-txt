\begin{abstract}
We introduce PyQBench, an innovative open-source framework for benchmarking 
gate-based quantum computers. PyQBench can benchmark NISQ devices by verifying their capability of
discriminating between two von Neumann measurements. PyQBench offers a simplified, ready-to-use,
command line interface (CLI) for running benchmarks using a predefined parametrized Fourier
family of measurements. For more advanced scenarios, PyQBench offers a way of employing user-defined
measurements instead of predefined ones.

\section{Motivation and significance}

Noisy intermediate-scale quantum
(NISQ)~\cite{preskill} devices are currently storming the market. We
have a selection of readily available quantum computers based on different
architectures. Historically, the first widely introduced quantum computing
architecture is D-Wave's quantum annealer~\cite{}. 

https://quantumcomputingreport.com/scorecards/qubit-technology/

Additional approaches to quantum computing are currently in development. For 
instance we have Ionq's computer based on ion traps and Xanadu's optical 
lattices. As they are in prototype versions no access to general public is 
provided. 

Next, we have computers implementing the gate model of quantum computation.
These are the best potentially developed machines, which can be thought
of as fully quantum computers, by which we understand that the qubits can be in
an entangled state. 

Currently one of the main providers of such architectures is Rigetti and its 
Quantum Cloud Services platform. The company has
released three generations of QPUs so far: Rigetti 8Q Agave, Rigetti 19Q Acorn
and Rigetti 16Q Aspen-1. The most recent one was deployed in November 2018 and
is a downgrade in terms of number of qubits compared to the previous 19 qubit
one. However, the new chip is reportedly much more robust to noise and the
proposed architecture is much easier to scale up. The new unit is supposed to
serve as a building block for a 128 qubit
system~\footnote{https://medium.com/rigetti/the-rigetti-128-qubit-chip-and-what-it-means-for-quantum-df757d1b71ea}.
As was the case for IBM, Rigetti also provides a \texttt{Python} library, 
\texttt{pyquil}~\cite{}, which enables easy access to the machine.

Now the natural question arises: how to construct a good metric of the
computational power of such devices? 
Lately, there have emerged propositions from the scientific community on how to
benchmark such devices.

 First let us mention the work by Michielsen
\emph{et.al.}~\cite{michielsen2017benchmarking}. In there the authors study the
IBM-QE device. Their first test is the creation of the entangled state
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\ket{01} - \ket{10})$. Next they implement a
two-qubit+two-qubit adder. Another test is an identity operation, realized by an
even number of CNOT operations. Their final test is a quantum error correction
scheme (is it possible with measurement-controlled-operations?). The final
conclusion is that, except for simple circuits, the device fails to return
correct results.

Another, recent approach is utilizing quantum communication protocols in testing
of quantum architectures~\cite{zhukov2019quantum}. Here, the authors decide to
utilize superdense coding and the BB84 quantum cryptography protocol as
benchmarks for the IBM Q devices. They utilize the mutual information of the
transferred bits as a figure of merit for the quantum computer.

Other approaches focus on generative model training. One of these
works~\cite{hamilton2018generative} is aimed at small architectures, up to 5
qubits. Another recently presented is much more
robust~\cite{benedetti2018generative}. The main drawback of both of them is the
level of complication.



The goal of this work is to introduce a new benchmark for Rigetti 
architecture...

In the scope of this Paper, we aim at  exploring ideas revolving around quantum

for this project is  introducing new concepts of benchmarks for NISQ devices 
benchmarking. This project aims to characterize the computing power and 
investigate possible practical applications of such devices having access by 
Amazon Braket. 





\subsubsection{Model specification}
The scenario assumes that Alice and Bob have access to an unknown measurement
device, a black box. Alice has hidden one of the two measurements, either $\PP$
or $\mathcal{Q}$, in the black box. Bob only has the information that the black box
performs one of these measurements. They want to determine an upper bound on the
probability of correct discrimination between $\PP$ and $\mathcal{Q}$. Moreover, they also want to
construct an optimal discrimination strategy to achieve the highest probability. Theoretical results were characterized in~\cite{puchala2018strategies}.



In this work, we will consider the problem of discrimination between von Neumann 
measurements. One of them on the computational basis, the second one on basis 
$U$, where $U$ is a unitary matrix. 
The scheme of discrimination can be divided into the following steps, which are 
illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:theoretical_scheme}.


\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=1.7]{pics/theoretical_scheme}
	\caption{Theoretical  scheme of discrimination  between von Neumann measurements $\PP_{U}$ and $\PP_\Id$. }

%	\caption{A schematic representation of the setup for distinguishing

%	\label{fig:scheme}
%\end{figure}


\begin{enumerate}
	\item Alice and Bob share an entangled state $\ket{\psi_{AB}}$ on systems 
	$A$ and $B$.
	\item Alice performs one of two known measurements (either $\PP_{\Id}$ or 
	$\PP_{U}$) on part $A$ of the input state  $\ket{\psi_{AB}}$ and measures the system $A$.
	\item Alice performs the conditional binary measurement $\PP_{V_i}$ on the part 
	$B$ based on the output label $i$. 
	\item  Bob measures the system $B$ of the input state  $\ket{\psi_{AB}}$ and 
	makes a decision based on the received label $j$. If $j=0$, then he decides 
	that the the black box contains $\PP_U$. Otherwise, he decides that the 
	black box contains $\PP_{\Id}$. 
\end{enumerate}  



\subsubsection{Quantum architecture's limits and practical solutions}



Let us take a closer look at the setup for distinguishing von Neumann 
measurements (see Fig.~\ref{fig:theoretical_scheme}). One of the components of 
this scheme is to perform a conditional binary measurement. 
Unfortunately, current NISQ devices do not allow for performing conditional 
binary measurements.
The only possible measurement performed on quantum architectures is the 
measurement in the computational basis. 
We  will present two possible methods providing a clever way to cross this 
obstacle. These will be two schemes of practical realization. 
The first method consists in using postselection while the second method 
consists in applying a controlled unitary. These methods are described below. 

\begin{scheme}(Postselection)



%\begin{figure}[h!]
%	\includegraphics[scale=1.5]{onequbit.pdf}
%	\caption{A schematic representation of the setup for distinguishing
%		measurements using postselection.}
%	\label{postselection}
%\end{figure}






\begin{enumerate}
\item Alice and Bob prepare an entangled state $\ket{\psi_{AB}}$ on systems 
$A$ and $B$.
\item Alice performs one of two quantum channels, either $\Phi_{\Id}$ or 
$\Phi_{U}$,  on part $A$ of the input state  $\ket{\psi_{AB}}$.
\item Alice measures part $A$ of the input state  $\ket{\psi_{AB}}$ and 
receives an output label $i$.
\item  
Based on Holevo--Helstrom theorem, Bob performs a conditional binary 
measurement	$\PP_{V_j^\dagger}$ on part $B$.
\item To calculate the probability of correct discrimination, they include just those cases for which $i = j$.
\item Bob measures part $B$ of the input state  $\ket{\psi_{AB}}$ and makes a
decision based on received label $j$. If $i=j=0$, then he decides that the 
black box contains $\PP_U$. Otherwise, he decides that the black box contains
$\PP_{\Id}$.
\end{enumerate}


The schematic representation of this setup is depicted in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:postsellection}.     

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering 
	\includegraphics[scale=1.7]{pics/postselection} 
	
	\caption{ A schematic representation of the setup for distinguishing
		measurements using postselection. 
	}\label{fig:postsellection}
\end{figure}  

Due to the fact that the measurement result is nondeterministic, we are forced to consider the following circuits
in the postselection procedure
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(\Phi_{U}, \mathcal{P}_{V_k}, i, j) \\ 
(\Phi_{\Id}, \mathcal{P}_{V_k}, i, j)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $k=\{0,1\}, i=\{0,1\}$ and $ j=\{0,1\}$. 
The optimal probability of correct discrimination between $\PP_{U} $ and $\PP_\Id$ is as follows.
		\begin{equation}
		p = \frac{\#(\Phi_U, \PP_{V_i},i,0) + \#(\Phi_\Id, \PP_{V_i},i,1)}{\#(\Phi_U, \PP_{V_i},i,j) + \#(\Phi_\Id, \PP_{V_i},i,j)}, 
		\end{equation}
where $i=\{0,1\}$ and $ j=\{0,1\}$. 

\end{scheme}


\begin{scheme}(By using controlled unitary)
	


\begin{enumerate}
\item Alice and Bob prepare an entangled state $\ket{\psi_{AB}}$ on 
systems $A$ and $B$.
\item Alice performs one of two quantum channels, either $\Phi_{\Id}$ or
$\Phi_{U}$,  on part $A$ of the input state  $\ket{\psi_{AB}}$.
\item Alice and Bob implement controlled unitary $V_0 \oplus V_1$ obtained from 
Holevo--Helstrom theorem.	
\item Alice and Bob prepare the measurement $\Delta$ in computational basis on 
their systems.
\item Bob makes a decision based on received label $j$. If $j=0$, then he
decides that the the black box contains $\PP_U$. Otherwise, he decides that the
black box contains $\PP_{\Id}$.
\end{enumerate}

The schematic representation of this setup is depicted in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:controlled}.     
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering 
	\includegraphics[scale=1.5]{pics/controlled_unitary} 
	
	\caption{ A schematic representation of the setup for distinguishing
		measurements using controlled unitary gate. 
	}\label{fig:controlled}
\end{figure} 


Here, we consider the following circuits
by using controlled unitary
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(\Phi_{U}, V_0 \oplus V_1, i, j) \\ 
(\Phi_{\Id},  V_0 \oplus V_1, i, j)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $i=\{0,1\}$ and $ j=\{0,1\}$. 
Then, the optimal probability of correct discrimination between $\PP_{U} $ and $\PP_\Id$ is as follows.
\begin{equation}
p = \frac{\#(\Phi_U,V_0 \oplus V_1,i,0) + \#(\Phi_\Id,V_0 \oplus V_1,i,1) }{\#(\Phi_U,V_0 \oplus V_1,i,j) + \#(\Phi_\Id,V_0 \oplus V_1,i,j)}
\end{equation}
where $i=\{0,1\}$ and $ j=\{0,1\}$. 
\end{scheme}




\subsubsection{Mathematical preliminaries}



Let $M_{d_1,d_2}$ be the set of all matrices of dimension $d_1 \times d_2$ over
the field $\mathbb{C}$. For  simplicity, square matrices will be denoted by
$M_d$.  The subset of $M_d$ consisting of Hermitian matrices of dimension $d$
will  be  denoted  by $\HH_d$,  while  the  set  of  positive semidefinite
matrices of dimension $d$ by $\HH_d^+$. The set of quantum states, that is
positive semidefinite operators having trace equal to one, will be denoted
$\Omega_d$. 
 The subset of $M_d$ consisting of unitary matrices will be denoted
by $\UU_d$, while its subgroup of diagonal unitary operators will be denoted by
$\DD \UU_d$. 
	An operator $A = \left( a_{i,j}\right)_{i,j} \in M_d$ is said to be a stochastic matrix if $a_{i,j} \ge 0$   and $\sum_{i} a_{i,j} = 1$.
Whereas an operator $A = \left( a_{i,j}\right)_{i,j} \in M_d$ is said to be a double stochastic matrix if $A$ is a stochastic matrix and $\sum_{j} a_{i,j} = 1$.


 We will also need a linear mapping transforming $M_{d_1}$ into
$M_{d_2}$, which will be denoted 
\begin{equation}
\Phi: M_{d_1 } \rightarrow M_{d_2}.
\end{equation} 
There
exists a bijection between introduced linear mappings $\Phi$ and set of matrices $M_{d_1d_2}$,  known as the Choi-
Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism. 
For a given linear mapping $\Phi_M$ corresponding  Choi operator $\mathcal{J}(\Phi)$ is explicitly written as 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{J}(\Phi) \coloneqq \sum_{i,j=1}^{d- 1} \Phi(\ketbra{i}{j}) \otimes \ketbra{i}{j}. \end{equation}
Finally, we introduce a special subset of all mappings $\Phi$, called quantum channels, which are completely positive
and trace preserving (CPTP).
In this work we will consider a special class of quantum channels, called unitary channels. Let $U \in \UU_d$ be a unitary operator. A unitary channel
$\Phi_{U}$ is defined as $\Phi_U(\cdot) = U \cdot U^\dagger$ for  $U \in 
\UU_d$. A general quantum
measurement, that is a positive operator valued measure (POVM) $\PP$ is a
collection of positive semidefinite operators $\{E_1, \ldots, E_m \}$ called
\emph{effects}, which sum up to identity, \ie $ \, \, \sum_{i=1}^m E_i = \1$. If
all the effects are rank-one projection operators, then such a measurement is
called a von Neumann measurement. Every von Neumann measurement can be
parameterized by a unitary matrix and hence we will use the notation $\PP_{U}$
for a von Neumann measurement with effects $\{\proj{u_0}, \ldots, \proj{u_{d-1}}\}$,
where $\ket{u_i}$ is the $i+1$-th column of the unitary matrix $U$. The action of
quantum measurement $\PP_{U}$ on some state $\rho \in \Omega_d$ can be
seen as  a measure-and-prepare quantum channel as follows 
$
\PP_{U} : \rho \rightarrow \sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \bra{u_i} \rho \ket{u_i} \proj{i}.
$ 

\subsubsection{Diamond norm and the task of discrimination between quantum operators}
This section defines a special norm on the space of linear mappings, known as 
the diamond norm, and establishes some of its properties. 
Next, we will explain the precise connection between the diamond
norm and the task of quantum operation discrimination. 

Let us  consider a  linear mapping transforming  square matrices into square 
matrices that is $\Phi: M_{d_1} \to M_{d_2}$. 
We define the diamond norm of a map $\Phi$ as 
\begin{equation}
\|\Phi\|_\diamond = \max_{\|X\|_1=1} \| \left(\Phi \otimes \1\right) (X) \|_1.
\end{equation}





The celebrated result by Helstrom~\cite{helstrom1976quantum} gives the optimal  probability of correct discrimination between two quantum operations, $\TT$  and $\SS$, 
in terms of their distance with the use of the diamond norm
\begin{equation}
p_{\text{succ}}(\TT, \SS) =  \frac12 + \frac14 \| \TT - \SS \|_\diamond.
\end{equation}
In the case of discrimination between two von Neumann measurements $\PP_U$ and 
$\PP_\Id$ we know that (from Theorem 1 in \cite{puchala2018strategies})
\begin{equation}
\|\PP_U - \PP_\Id\|_\diamond = \min_{E \in \diaguni_d} \|\Phi_{UE} - 
\Phi_\Id\|_\diamond,
\end{equation}
where $\Phi_U$ is unitary channel and $\diaguni_d$ be the set of diagonal 
unitary matrices of dimension $d$. 



\paragraph{Discrimination of unitary channels}

Before we proceed to presenting our main results, we need to briefly discuss the
problem of discrimination of unitary channels.  For this purpose, we introduce the notion of numerical range of
a given matrix $A \in M_d$. The set \begin{equation}
W(A) =\{\bra{x}A\ket{x}: \ket{x} \in 
\mathbb{C}^d, \;
\;\braket{x}{x}=1\}.
\end{equation}   
is the numerical range of $A$.
The detailed properties of the numerical range and its generalizations we can see on the website~\cite{nr}. 



 Let us now recall the well-known result for the
distinguishability of unitary channels.
	Let $U \in \UU_d$ and $\Phi_U$ be a unitary 
	channel. 
	Then, the following equation holds
	\begin{equation}
	\| \Phi_U  - \Phi_{\1} \|_\diamond = 2 \sqrt{1-\nu^2},
	\end{equation}
	where $\nu = \min_{x \in W(U^\dagger)} |x|  $. And hence the optimal probability to discriminate two unitary channel is given by 
	\begin{equation}
	p_{\text{succ}}(\Phi_U, \Phi_\Id) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{1-\nu^2}.
	\end{equation}




%In the general case, the diamond norm of a Hermiticity-preserving maps $\Phi$ 
%can be computed using the Semidefinite Program~\cite{watrous2018theory} and 
%state 
%primal and dual problem in the following form:

%			& X \in M_{d1,d2}.

%			& Y \in \HH_{d_1d_2}^+.
%		\end{split}
%	\end{equation*}
%	\vspace{0.5cm}
%\end{minipage} 





\section{Illustrative Example}

Let us focus on single-qubit von Neumann measurements $\PP_\1$ and $\PP_U$.
Assume that the unitary matrix $U$ is of the form 
\begin{equation}
U = H 
\left(\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\0&e^{i \phi}\end{array}\right)  H^\dagger
\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%U = H \diag (1, \ee^{\ii \phi}) H^\dagger,
%\end{equation}
where $H$ is the Hadamard matrix of dimension two and $\phi \in [0, 2 \pi)$.
In this section we present theoretical probability of correct 
discrimination between these measurements. Moreover, we create the optimal 
theoretical strategy of their discrimination. 
The otimal probability will be calculated in 
subsection~\ref{sec:example_theoretical_probability}. Later, we will 
discuss the realization of this scheme in 
subsection~\ref{sec:example_realization}. For such realization, we 
will need the proper input state, (see sec.~\ref{sec:example_discriminator}) 
and final measurement (see sec.~\ref{sec_example_final_measurement}). 

\subsection{Theoretical probability}\label{sec:example_theoretical_probability}

In this section we calculate the theoretical probability of correct discrimination between two von Neumann measurements $\PP_\1$ and $\PP_U$ for $U = H \diag(1, e^{i \phi}) H^\dagger$, where  $\phi \in [0, 2\pi)$.  To do that, we will present an auxiliary lemma.   
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:min-e-optimal}
Let $U = H \diag(1, e^{i \phi}) H^\dagger$, $\phi \in [0, 2\pi)$ and	let 
$\Phi_U$ and $\Phi_\Id$ be two unitary channels. Then, the following equation holds 
\begin{equation}
\min_{E \in \diaguni_2} \|\Phi_{UE} - 
\Phi_\Id\|_\diamond = \|\Phi_{U} - 
\Phi_\Id\|_\diamond,
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} Recall that the distance between two unitary channels is given by
	$
	\| \Phi_U  - \Phi_{\1} \|_\diamond = 2 \sqrt{1-\nu^2},
	$
	where $\nu = \min_{x \in W(U^\dagger)} |x|  $ for any $U \in \mathcal{U}_d$. 
	For $U = H 
	\left(\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\0&e^{i \phi}\end{array}\right)  H^\dagger$ the readers briefly observe that  $\nu^2 = 1 - \frac{|1 - e^{-i \phi} |^2 }{4} = 1 - \frac{|1 - e^{i \phi} |^2 }{4}$. So, 
	\begin{equation}
	\|  \Phi_U  - \Phi_{\1} \|_\diamond = | 1 - e^{i \phi} |. 
	\end{equation} 
		It implies that it is enough to prove  \begin{equation}
		\min_{E \in \diaguni_2} \|\Phi_{UE} - 
		\Phi_\Id\|_\diamond  = | 1 - e^{i \phi} |.
		\end{equation}
%		It implies that we can prove  equivalently  the following condition
%		\begin{equation}
%		\max_{E \in \diaguni_2 } \nu_{UE} = \nu_U
%		\end{equation}
This condition is equivalent to 
	\begin{equation}
	\max_{E \in \diaguni_2 } \nu_{E} = \frac{|1 + e^{i \phi} | }{2},
	\end{equation}
	where $\nu_E = \min_{x \in W(U^\dagger E)} |x|. $ 
	
%	For simplify notation, let 	$ \nu \coloneqq \max_{E \in \diaguni_2 } \nu_{E} $.
 The celebrated Hausdorf-T{\o}plitz theorem~\cite{hausdorff, toeplitz} states that
$W(A)$ of any matrix $A \in M_d$ is a convex set and therefore
\begin{equation}
W(A) = \{ \tr(A \rho): \rho \in \Omega_d\}. 
\end{equation}
So we obtain that 
	\begin{equation}
	\min_{\ket{x} \in \mathbb{C}^2:   \proj{x} = 1} |\bra{x}U^\dagger\ket{x}| = 
	\min_{\rho \in \Omega_2} |\tr(U^\dagger\rho)|. 
	\end{equation}
	And then we have 
	 \begin{equation}
 \max_{E \in \diaguni_2 } \nu_{E}  = \max_{E \in \diaguni_2 }  \min_{\rho \in 
		\Omega_2} \left| \tr \left( \rho U E \right) \right|
	\end{equation}
	For that, our task is reduce to show that
	\begin{equation}
	\forall_{E \in \diaguni_2} \,\, | \tr \left(\rho U E\right) | \le \mu
	\end{equation}
	where $\mu \coloneqq \max_{E \in \diaguni_2 } \nu_{E}.$
	
	
	Let us define $E = \left(\begin{array}{cc}E_0&0\\0&E_1\end{array}\right)  $ 
	and take $\rho = 
	\left(\begin{array}{cc}\frac{1}{2}&0\\0&\frac{1}{2}\end{array}\right) $. 
	From spectral theorem, let us decompose $U$ as
	\begin{equation}
	U= \lambda_1 \ketbra{x_1}{x_1} + \lambda_2 \ketbra{x_1}{x_2}, 
	\end{equation}
	where  for eigenvalue $\lambda_1 = 1$, the corresponding 
	eigenvector is 
	of the form $\ket{x_1} = \left[\begin{array}{c}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\\\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\end{array}\right]
	$,
	whereas for  $\lambda_2 = e^{i \phi}$ we have $\ket{x_2} = \left[\begin{array}{c}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\\-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\end{array}\right] 
	$.
	Then, we have 
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	& \forall E \in \diaguni_2 \,\,\, | \tr (\rho U E) | = \frac{1}{2}  \left| \tr \left(
	H \diag(1, e^{i\phi}) H^\dagger E \right) \right| =  \\ &
	\frac{1}{2} \left| \tr\left((   \proj{x_1} +e^{i \phi}\proj{x_2} ) E \right) 
	\right|  = 
	\frac{1}{2} \left|  \bra{x_1} E \ket{x_1} +  e^{i \phi}\bra{x_2} E \ket{x_2} 
	\right| = \\& 
	\frac{1}{2} \left| \frac{E_0 + E_1}{2} + e^{i \phi } \frac{E_0+E_1}{2} \right| 
	= 
	\frac{\left| 1+ e^{i \phi } \right|}{2} \left| \frac{E_0 + E_1}{2} \right| \le 
	\mu, 
	\end{split}
	\end{equation}
	which completes the proof.
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}
The optimal probability of correct discrimination between von Neumann
measurements $\PP_U$ and $\PP_{\Id}$ for $U = H \diag(1, e^{i \phi}) H^\dagger$,
where $\phi \in [0, 2\pi)$ is given by
\begin{equation}
p_{\text{succ}}(\PP_{U}, \PP_{\Id}) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{|1 - e^{i \phi}  |}{4} . 
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	From Holevo-Helstrom theorem we obtain
	\begin{equation}
p_{\text{succ}}(\PP_{U}, \PP_{\Id}) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} \| \PP_{U} - \PP_{\Id} \|_\diamond.
	\end{equation}
	From Theorem 1 in~\cite{puchala2018strategies} we have 
	\begin{equation}
	\|\PP_U - \PP_\Id\|_\diamond = \min_{E \in \diaguni_d} \|\Phi_{UE} - 
	\Phi_\Id\|_\diamond. 
	\end{equation}
	From Lemma~\ref{lemma:min-e-optimal} we know that for 
	$U =  H \diag(1, e^{i \phi}) H^\dagger$ it also holds that
	\begin{equation}
		\min_{E \in \diaguni_2} \|\Phi_{UE} - 
	\Phi_\Id\|_\diamond = \|\Phi_{U} - 
	\Phi_\Id\|_\diamond,
	\end{equation} which is exactly equal to 
	\begin{equation}
	\|\Phi_{U} - 
	\Phi_\Id\|_\diamond = 2\sqrt{1 - \nu^2} = |1-e^{i   \phi }|. 
	\end{equation}
%	Finally, we obtain that
%	\begin{equation}
%	\| \PP_{U} - \PP_{\Id} \|_\diamond =  |1-e^{i   \phi }|.
%	\end{equation}
	It implies that
	\begin{equation}
	p_{\text{succ}}(\PP_{U}, \PP_{\Id}) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{|1-e^{i \phi}|}{4},
	\end{equation} which completes the proof.
\end{proof}





\subsection{Realization}\label{sec:example_realization}
Now we focus on the realization of the discrimination protocol. We will 
discriminate between $\PP_U$ and $\PP_\1$. To do so, we need to know exact 
forms of the input state and final measurement. We will indicate the optimal 
input state in subsection~\ref{sec:example_discriminator} and the final 
measurement in subsection~\ref{sec_example_final_measurement}.


\subsubsection{Discriminator}\label{sec:example_discriminator}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop-discrim}
Consider the problem of discrimination between von Neumann measurements $\PP_U$ 
and $\PP_\1$, $U = H\diag(1, e^{i \phi}) H^\dagger $ and $\phi \in [0, 
2\pi)$.  The optimal input state has the form
\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi_{AB}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |\Id_2 \rangle \rangle.
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let $U = H\diag(1, e^{i \phi}) H^\dagger, \phi \in [0, 
2\pi)$ be decomposed as 
	\begin{equation}
	U= \lambda_1 \ketbra{x_1}{x_1} + \lambda_2 \ketbra{x_1}{x_2}, 
	\end{equation}
	where  for eigenvalue $\lambda_1 = 1$, the corresponding 
	eigenvector is 
	of the form $\ket{x_1} = \left[\begin{array}{c}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\\\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\end{array}\right]
	$,
	whereas for  $\lambda_2 = e^{i \phi}$ we have $\ket{x_2} = \left[\begin{array}{c}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\\-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\end{array}\right] 
	$.
	
For Hermitian-preserving maps \cite{watrous} the diamond norm may be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\| \Phi  \|_\diamond =  \max_{\rho \in \Omega_d} \| \left( \Id \otimes \sqrt{\rho} \right) \mathcal{J}(\Phi)  \left( \Id \otimes \sqrt{\rho} \right)  \|_1.  \end{equation}
Hence, we obtain
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\| \PP_{U} - \PP_{\Id}  \|_\diamond 
& =  \max_{\rho \in \Omega_2} \left\| \left( \Id \otimes \sqrt{\rho} \right) 
\mathcal{J}(\PP_{U} - \PP_{\Id} )  \left( \Id \otimes \sqrt{\rho} \right)  \right\|_1   
\\ 
& =  \max_{\rho \in \Omega_2} \left\| \left( \Id \otimes \sqrt{\rho} \right) 
\sum_{i=0}^{1} \proj{i} \otimes \left( \proj{u_i} - \proj{i} \right)^\top  
\right\|_1  \\ 
& = \max_{\rho \in \Omega_2} \left\| \sum_{i=0}^{1} \proj{i} \otimes 
\sqrt{\rho}  \left( \proj{u_i} - \proj{i} \right)^\top \sqrt{\rho}  \right\|_1  
\\ 
& = \max_{\rho \in \Omega_2} \left\| \sum_{i=0}^{1}\sqrt{\rho}  \left( 
\proj{u_i} - \proj{i} \right)^\top \sqrt{\rho}  \right\|_1
\end{split}
\end{equation}
One can prove that for all $\alpha, \beta \ge 0 $, and unit vectors $\ket{x}, 
\ket{y}$ the following equation holds~\cite{watrous} 
\begin{equation}
\| \alpha \proj{x} - \beta\proj{y} \|_1 = \sqrt{(\alpha + \beta)^2 - 4\alpha 
\beta |\braket{x}{y}|^2}.
\end{equation}
By taking $\ket{x} = \frac{\sqrt{\rho} \ket{\bar{u_i}}}{\| \sqrt{\rho} 
\ket{\bar{u_i}} \|}$ and $ \ket{y} = \frac{\sqrt{\rho} \ket{i}}{\|\sqrt{\rho} 
\ket{i} \|}$ we have
\begin{equation}
	\| \PP_{U} - \PP_{\Id}  \|_\diamond  = \max_{\rho \in \Omega_2} 
	\sum_{i=0}^{1} \sqrt{\left( \bra{u_i} \rho \ket{u_i} + \bra{i} \rho \ket{i 
	}\right)^2 - 4 | \bra{u_i} \rho \ket{i} |^2}.
\end{equation}
Let us take  $\rho_0 =   \frac{1}{2}  	
\left(\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\0&1\end{array}\right)  $,   we obtain
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
||\mathcal{P}_U - \mathcal{P}_{\1}||_\diamond 
&= \sum_{i=0}^1  
\sqrt{\left(\bra{u_i}\rho_0\ket{u_i} + \bra{i} \rho_0 \ket{i} \right)^2 - 
	4|\bra{i}\rho_0\ket{u_i}|^2}  \\
&= \sum_{i=0}^1  \sqrt{ 1 -  \left| \bra{i}  U \ket{i }\right|^2} 
\\ 
&=\sum_{i=0}^1  \sqrt{1 -  \left| 1 \cdot \bra{i} \proj{u_1} 
	\ket{i} + e^{i \phi} \cdot\bra{i}  \proj{u_2}\ket{i}\right|^2} \\
&= \sum_{i=0}^1 
 \sqrt{1 -\left| \frac{1+ e^{i \phi}}{2}\right|^2 } 
= 2 \sqrt{1 -\left| \frac{1+e^{i \phi}}{2}\right|^2 } \\
&= |1-e^{i \phi }|.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Observe that
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\| \PP_{U} - \PP_{\Id}  \|_\diamond  
&=  \| \left( \Id \otimes \sqrt{\rho} \right) \mathcal{J}(\PP_{U} - \PP_{\Id} )  \left( 
\Id \otimes \sqrt{\rho} \right) \|_1 \\
&= \left\| ( (\PP_{U} - \PP_\Id) \otimes \Id) \left(  | \sqrt{\rho}^\top 
\rangle \rangle \langle \langle \sqrt{\rho}^\top | \right) \right\|_1.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Due to that, we know  
that $\left| \sqrt{\rho_0}^{\top} \rangle \right\rangle$ is the discriminator of the problem 
of discrimination between 
$\PP_{\Id} $ and $\PP_U$ for 
$ U =  H \diag(1, e^{i \phi}) H^\dagger$ (from definition of diamond norm 
).      Hence we obtain that \begin{equation}
\ket{\psi_{AB}} \coloneqq   | \sqrt{\rho}^\top \rangle \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} } | 
\Id_2 \rangle \rangle,
\end{equation}
which completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Conditional measurement}\label{sec_example_final_measurement}
In this subsection we will derive exact form of the conditional measurement in the
problem of discrimination of von Neumann measurements $\PP_U$ and $\PP_{\Id}$
for $U = H \diag(1, e^{i \phi}) H^\dagger$, where $\phi \in [0, 2\pi)$.


\begin{proposition}
	Consider the problem of discrimination between von Neumann measurements $\PP_U$ 
	and $\PP_\1$, $U = H\diag(1, e^{i \phi}) H^\dagger $ and $\phi \in [0, 
	2\pi)$.  
The  conditioned measurement has the form
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mu(0) = \proj{0} \otimes V_0 \proj{0} V_0^\dagger +  \proj{1} \otimes V_1 
\proj{0} V_1^\dagger  \\ 
\mu(1) = \proj{0} \otimes V_0 \proj{1} V_0^\dagger +  \proj{1} \otimes V_1 
\proj{1} V_1^\dagger,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where for each $\phi \in \mathbb{R}$,  the controlled unitaries $V_0$ and $V_1$ 
have the form
\begin{equation}
V_0 = \left(\begin{array}{cc}i \sin\left( \frac{\pi - \phi}{4} \right)&-i 
\cos\left( \frac{\pi - \phi}{4} \right)\\ \cos\left( \frac{\pi - 
\phi}{4}\right)& \sin\left( \frac{\pi - \phi}{4} \right)\end{array}\right),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
V_1 = \left(\begin{array}{cc}-i \cos\left(\frac{\pi - \phi}{4}\right) &i 
\sin\left( \frac{\pi - \phi}{4}\right)\\\sin\left( \frac{\pi - \phi}{4} \right) 
&  \cos\left( \frac{\pi - \phi}{4} \right) \end{array}\right).
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}


\begin{proof}
From Proposition~\ref{prop-discrim} we have the form of discriminator given by
\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi} = | \sqrt{\rho}^\top \rangle \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |\Id_2 
\rangle \rangle. 
\end{equation}
From Holevo-Helstrom theorem  we constrain a conditional measurement $\mu$.  
Let us define 
\begin{equation}
X  = \left( \PP_U \otimes \Id_2 \right)(\proj{\psi}) -  \left( \PP_\Id 
\otimes \Id_2 \right)(\proj{\psi}).
\end{equation} 
From the Hahn-Jordan decomposition, let us note
\begin{equation}
X = P - Q
\end{equation}
where $P, Q \ge 0 $. 
Let us define projectors $\Pi_P$ and $\Pi_Q$ onto  $\text{im}(P)$ and $\text{im}(Q)$, 
respectively. Observe, that $P $ and $Q$ are block-diagonal.  Then,  $\Pi_P$ and $\Pi_Q$ have the following forms
\begin{equation}
\Pi_P = \left(\begin{array}{cc}\proj{x_p}&0\\0&\proj{y_p}\end{array}\right) 
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
\Pi_Q = \left(\begin{array}{cc}\proj{x_q}&0\\0&\proj{y_q}\end{array}\right). 
\end{equation}
Hence, we define $V_0$ such that
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases} V_0 \ket{x_p} = \ket{0} \\ V_0 \ket{x_q} = \ket{1} \end{cases}
\end{equation}
and $V_1$ such that
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases} 
V_1 \ket{y_p} = \ket{0} \\ 
V_1 \ket{y_q} = \ket{1}
\end{cases}. 
\end{equation}
For the discrimination task between $\PP_{U}$ and $\PP_{\Id}$, where $U = H 
\diag(1, e^{i \phi })H$, the explicit form of $V_0$ and $V_1$ is given as 
follows (see also \texttt{one-qubit.nb}).
The unitary $V_0$ has the form
\begin{equation}
V_0 = \left(
\begin{array}{cc}i \sin\left( \frac{\pi - \phi}{4} \right)&-i 
\cos\left( \frac{\pi - \phi}{4} \right)\\ \cos\left( \frac{\pi - 
\phi}{4}\right)& \sin\left( \frac{\pi - \phi}{4} \right)
\end{array}
\right),
\end{equation}
whereas the unitary  $V_1$  has the form
\begin{equation}
V_1 = \left(\begin{array}{cc}-i \cos\left(\frac{\pi - \phi}{4}\right) &i 
\sin\left( \frac{\pi - \phi}{4}\right)\\\sin\left( \frac{\pi - \phi}{4} 
\right) &  \cos\left( \frac{\pi - \phi}{4} \right) \end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
for all $\phi \in [0,2\pi)$. 
Finally, we obtain the measurement $\mu$ of the form
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mu(0) = \proj{0} \otimes V_0 \proj{0} V_0^\dagger +  \proj{1} \otimes V_1 
\proj{0} V_1^\dagger  \\ 
\mu(1) = \proj{0} \otimes V_0 \proj{1} V_0^\dagger +  \proj{1} \otimes V_1 
\proj{1} V_1^\dagger.  
\end{split}
\end{equation} 



\end{proof}
