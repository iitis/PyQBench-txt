Reviewer #2
The benchmarking idea (von Neumann Measurements) is well described and convincing.

I have two main comments:
1) Please extend state-of-the-art: The topic is very hot, including ongoing standardization activities.

I am not a fan of listing references, but I am aware of couple of recent papers on the topic which should be accomodated in state-of-the-art.

2) Please add more visual material on the SW architecture - UML Diagrams, Component Diagrams --> you can put them in the main part of the paper, such
that the presentation is easier to follow
