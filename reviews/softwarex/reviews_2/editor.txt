Your paper is quite a bit over our limit of 3000 words. And I am not sure about your supplementary material - usually it is meant for things other than text.  You might put the supplementary text into your repository and provide a link.

Some of the text - like section 2 - could be put into an appendix.  You provide a lot of text on other work.

As am not an expert, I don't know what is a NISQ device.  After line 1 of the intro, you start reviewing other work.  Can you instead explain what is a NISQ and why it is interesting.  While it is important to reference other work (as in the first paragraph of the paper), I find it provided me no information as a general reader.  Again, maybe it can be more concise (just provide references or reference a review paper)?

450 lines is about 5000 words Try to get down to 3500 words.  You tend to be verbose and could be more terse in your text.

Also there were figures in the figure (with stick men) that were not in the paper.

(I stopped fixing the language after the first section - please review the rest of the paper)

Section 2 - make it an appendix.
